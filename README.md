# BreakRoom Lite

BreakRoom is a locally stored bundle of games used to allow students to bypass accidental blockages by faulty software. BreakRoom will allow sophisticated debugging software (e.g. Inspect Element for the purpose of fixing errors) in the near future to aid technical accidents. BreamRoom Lite allows users to enjoy entertainment without distractions.



# BreamRoom is not intended to be a game service. There will be under no circumstances any liability from me. The MIT License dictates this. Users are entitled to their own self-supervision for any activites done on BreakRoom.
